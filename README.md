# Cryptoversion
Converts BTC to USD and then to crypto-coin of choice using Python. Really simple Python script that my friend helped me with as an intro to Python.

# Instructions

 Takes JSON price data off of Coinbase to get dollar value of bitcoin and fetches LTC-to-BTC price from BTC-E.
 
# Why this?
 
I found a lot of the exchanges used wire transfers or services I didn't want to trust to exchange altcoins to US dollars and pay extra fees as well. Coinbase makes things pretty simple.
